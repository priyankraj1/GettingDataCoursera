This codebook provides additional information to the codebooks originally
contained in "UCI HAR Dataset/".

The script "run_analysis.R" will merge and clean training and test data sets
from "UCI HAR Dataset/" and generate two data sets in the csv format:

"data_mean-std_step4.csv" ->
This data set merges both training and test set, with only the measurements with 
"mean" or "std"" (case-insensitive) in the name being considered. The variable
names are descriptive. Two more columns, activity (descriptive) and subject 
(number), are added.

"data_ave_step5.csv" ->
This data set derives from the "data_mean-std_step4.csv" (set-4). It contains 
mean values of all the variable in set-4, except for activity and subject 
columns. The mean evaluation is done with observations grouped by BOTH
activity and subject. The name of variables stay the same as in set-4, while the
values are in fact mean values.
